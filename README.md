## Left

This blog is forked from Left:
Left is a clean, whitespace-happy layout for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).
 
If you'd like give \[the author\] credit somewhere on your blog or tweet a shout out to

 [CNAME](https://github.com/holman/left/blob/gh-pages/CNAME): If you're using
  this on GitHub Pages with a custom domain name, you'll want to change this
  to be the domain you're going to use. All that should be in here is a
  domain name on the first line and nothing else (like: `example.com`).
