## Left

This blog is forked from Left:
Left is a clean, whitespace-happy layout for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).
 
If you'd like give \[the author\] credit somewhere on your blog or tweet a shout out to
[@holman](https://twitter.com/holman), well hey.

 [CNAME](https://github.com/holman/left/blob/gh-pages/CNAME): If you're using
  this on GitHub Pages with a custom domain name, you'll want to change this
  to be the domain you're going to use. All that should be in here is a
  domain name on the first line and nothing else (like: `example.com`).

## Deployment

Left is designed to be deployed to [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com). It
uses [repository metadata](https://help.github.com/articles/repository-metadata-on-github-pages)
to generate some of your content, like your GitHub URL and avatar information (so you
might not actually see it locally until you push it up to Pages).

## Licensing

This is [MIT](https://github.com/holman/left/blob/gh-pages/LICENSE) with no
added caveats, so feel free to use this on your site without linking back to
me or using a disclaimer or anything silly like that.
