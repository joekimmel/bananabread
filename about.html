  <h1>Chemistry Schmemistry</h1>
  <p>
    Bakers are always like,   "you can't just improvise - it's a delicate chemical process."   but bolstered by some minor successes,  this blog uses the following rough framework for improvisational baking.
  </p>

  <h3>"cookies"</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> at least 1/2 cup of flour,   at least 1/2 of which has gluten </li>
    <li> at least 1/4 cup sugar </li>
    <li> at least 1 egg</li>
    <li> probably some salt </li>
    <li> anything else you want, up to doubling the total dough volume</li>
    <li> drop onto parchment paper, don't make this hard </li>
    <li>bake at 350 for 15-20 minutes,  until they're probably done</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>"banana bread"</h3>
  <p>
    some might call this 'quick bread'  but that's misleading. Buying bread is quick, especially if you're already at the grocery store.
  </p>
  <li> roughly two cups of flour,  at least 1/4 of which has gluten</li>
  <li> salt</li>
  <li> some sugar if you feel like</li>
  <li> 2 eggs, plus or minus an egg </li>
  <li>baking soda  (i dunno how much, who measures things?   1/2 tsp?  1/4 tsp?)</li>
  <li> some bananas or almost any other produce, similar or smaller in volume to your flour</li>
  <li> pour into a greased recepticle and bake at 350 for 60-75 minutes, until a knife comes out clean or it's probably done</li>

  <h3>"Pancacakes"</h3>
  <p>
    Make banana bread batter but fry it in a pan, probably in butter.

  <h2>About the Author</h2>
  Hi my name is Joe and I work in a button factory. OK not quite but I write software for a living, so kinda?
  <br>
  I'm an award winning chef, in the sense that one time my friend Jess and I won a kimchi cook-off with recipes we developed together using kimchi my wife and i made. Let's not talk too much about how there were only 2.5 teams competing, or how do you even have half a team what is this story.
  <br>
  <p>
    Anyway I made this blog to share all my great recipes with you.
