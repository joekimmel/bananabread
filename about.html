  <h1>Chemistry Schmemistry</h1>
So i feel like bakers are always like,   "you can't just improvise - it's a delicate chemical process."   but bolstered by some minor successes,  i'd like to propose a safe framework for improvisational baking.

let's define our terms:

<h3>"cookies"</h3>
<ul>
  <li> at least 1/2 cup of flour,   at least 1/2 of which has gluten </li>
  <li> at least 1/4 cup sugar </li>
  <li> at least 1 egg</li>
  <li> probably some salt </li>
  <li> anything else you want, up to doubling the total dough volume</li>
  <li> drop onto parchment paper, don't make this hard </li>
  <li>bake at 350 for 15-20 minutes,  until they're probably done</li>
</ul>

<h3>"banana bread"</h3>
<p>
   some might call this 'quick bread'  but that's misleading. Buying bread is quick, especially if you're already at the grocery store.
 </p>
   <li> roughly two cups of flour,  at least 1/4 of which has gluten</li>
   <li> salt</li>
   <li> some sugar if you feel like</li>
   <li> 2 eggs</li>
   <li>baking soda  (i dunno how much, who measures things?   1/2 tsp?  1/4 tsp?)</li>
   <li> some bananas or almost any other produce, similar or smaller in volume to your flour</li>
   <li> pour into a greased recepticle and bake at 350 for 60-75 minutes, until a knife comes out clean or it's probably done</li>
