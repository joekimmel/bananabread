title: Banana Bread Du Jour; Vegan Savory Chickpea Pancake
category: posts
---

### Genesis

It's been maybe two-ish years since your friends moved to Portland and left you with some chickpea flour. You were totally gonna get to this! ... sooner!

### To prepare

You can google the recipe, but the gist of it is: equal parts chickpea flour and water,
add salt, olive oil, more olive oil, and let the batter sit for 30 minutes to rehydrate the something boring i dunno, chemistry or some nerd stuff.

While that's soaking preheat your cast iron skillet to 400+ F, which has the side effect of also preheating your oven. 

The online recipes are wrong though: you should definitely add a dash of msg, more olive oil, and some freshly ground herbs de provence. They also seem to think you're making a snack in a 10-inch skillet, whereas you're really making an entree in a 12-inch skillet, so scale the recipe up appropriately.

When you pour the batter into the pan it should sizzle lightly. 

Set your oven to broil and place pan in the top rack, baking for 8-ish minutes.

### Reviews

- 9/10 one of my favorite banana breads

Vaughnda liked it a lot too but I can't remember a thing she said. Also we didn't take pictures.
