### To Make

I'm not gonna lie it's basically just adding cocoa powder to
[Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies]({% post_url 2020-08-16-peanut-butter-chocolate-chip-cookies %}) but let's break it down.

Preheat your oven to 350 F.

Go a little heavy on the flour. Use half white and half amaranth flour. The amaranth flour bag says it's good for cookies, and what company would lie to you in their own marketing materials? Certainly not Bob's Red Mills, an employee owned company!

Add an amount of cocoa powder similar to the amount of white flour you used. Remember to add all those other dry ingredients like salt, baking soda, and sugar. Actually add a little more sugar because you don't want the cocoa to be too bitter or dry.

Mix the dry ingredients.

Add peanut butter in generous proportions, vanilla, an egg, and mix. Add a little water if the dough is too stiff, which it probably is.

Add chocolate chips and stir to incorporate. Do you like how I said "mix" on the line above, but "stir to incorporate" on this line?

Plop out onto parchment-paper lined baking tray and salt the tops.

Bake for about 20 minutes.


## Reviews
A touch dry and maybe you used too much baking soda or maybe amaranth flour has a little flavor you don't quite like, but these taste like they're almost brownies. It's great. You probably (ok, definitely) ate half the batch in a few hours while you were stressed out over something at work.

- 9/10 the only thing better would've been actual brownies.
- Vaughnda liked them too but we were both having lousy days and she just emailed me midday like "I should have taken all the cookies in the world. Death by cookies."
